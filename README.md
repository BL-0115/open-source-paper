Brief History of and Defining Copyleft
	The internet has revolutionized the way individuals communicate with one another and share media. It has become easier than ever to quickly download files from the world wide web as well as upload them to share with people around the world. Protection in the form of Copyright has been put into place to protect the intellectual property rights of individuals that upload media to the web. In the vein of software development, developers can use copyright law to prohibit reproduction, derivation, and distribution of their systems. However, a movement has arisen that runs counter to the general usage of copyright: the aptly named copyleft movement.
	 The term copyleft is believed to have originated in the latter half of the 20th century. According to ‘Copyleft: The rise of open-source software licensing’, an article available on synk.io, the term’s first appearance is in Dr. Li-Chen Wang’s Tiny BASIC program published in 1976. However, the term gained more traction when American software programmer Richard Stallman began developing GNU’s Not Unix (GNU). According to the official GNU website, gnu.org, the development of the software began in January of 1984.
	Placing one’s software in the public domain when publishing it is an option to give users more freedom over how they use the material. However, this may be ill advised, as a middleman could modify the software and cut out features or restrict the freedoms of the user. This is one reason that one may consider utilizing copyleft. 
	Despite its name, copyleft makes use of copyright law to ensure that licensed software remains open source. According to the official GNU website, “Proprietary software developers use copyright to take away the users’ freedom; we use copyright to guarantee their freedom.” (“What is Copyleft?”) When a developer “copylefts” their software, they are copyrighting it and then adding “distribution terms”. These terms include: every user has the right to use, modify, and redistribute the source code. The primary stipulation with these terms is that software that is derivative of another copylefted work must agree to remain free and open source, or it cannot be published.
	Generally, when a software is copyrighted, it must be done so under a specific license. The same rings true for copylefted software. According to “Copyleft Definition” on linfo.org, the most common type of license for copylefted software is the “GNU General Public License (GPL).” The GPL was originally authored and published by Richard Stallman in 1989. A second version of the GPL was published in 1991, and the most recent update, version 3, was published in 2007. While the GPL is the most popular “free software” license, it is not the only one to exist.
	Several other types of copyleft licenses include the Mozilla Public License, Eclipse Public License, and the Open Software License (Miller). The Mozilla Public License requires that the source code of the software be available upon release, though not other proprietary components. This is also the license under which the popular Firefox browser is licensed. The Eclipse Public License does not require the source code to be published, though there must be a link to proprietary code. Finally, the Open Software License is very similar to the GPL, as it requires the source to be disclosed.
	 Open-source software and copyleft licensing continues to be an important contribution to modern computing. A recent development in copyleft field is the introduction of the copyleft symbol, a backwards “C” in a circle which is the reverse of the copyright symbol, into Unicode in 2016 (Miller). Copyleft licensing continues to be utilized to this day, with popular software such as Firefox and Java utilizing copyleft licenses.
